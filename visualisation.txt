The website has been hosted in the ECS web space. 
The link for the website is the following:
			http://students.ecs.soton.ac.uk/tl3n17/
It contains a visualisation of the data using Stacked Bar Chart. 
In addition, there is a description of what the visualisation illustrates, who the intended audience is, and how the visualisation is interactive.
Users are not expected to do something specific to host a copy of the visualisation. 
In case the user has the D3 library in his computer the only thing he needs is the main.html file, the main.js file, and the style.css. 
By running the main.html the visualisation is presented.

The audience to which this visualisation concerns is analysed inside the website.
More specifically, by pressing the button "Who the intended audience is" information about the audience appears.

In addition, the interactivity of the visualisation is discussed in the website in the button "How the visualisation is interactive".

For the visualisation four columns of the cleaned database were used, COMPLETION_DATE, ESTIMATED_COMPLETION_DATE, ACTUAL_COST, and ESTIMATED_COST. 
These columns needed modification to know whether the Departments finished the projects ahead of schedule and within their budget. 
Thus, the first step was to create two new columns with the difference between the Actual and the Projected Completion date, and the difference between the Actual and the Estimated Cost.
The next step was to create a column which indicates the category (in time-in budget, in time-overbudget, overtime-overbudget, overtime-in budget) each project belongs to, and finally, sum each category.
